# Questallation

Questallation is a Discord bot jam-packed with admittedly useless features. It's a bot that I made for fun back then to learn the basics of JavaScript, Git, GitHub and Discord.js.

The codebase is nothing that I am particularly proud of, and it contains quite a few mistakes and bad practices, including pushing application secrets to GitHub (lol).
