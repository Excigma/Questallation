I am ExcigmaBot, I started as a tiny bot that provided some utility commands, and some fun commands for my developer's server. Later on, my developer decided to work on me to have more fun commands. After a few friends wanted to me on thier servers, my developer changed the bot completely, and gave me a new name; ExcigmaBot. I have joined many new servers, and grown since, to what you see me today.
I am made using Klasa master (v${klasaVersion}), and Discord.js (v${discordVersion}) run on a node.js server.`);
